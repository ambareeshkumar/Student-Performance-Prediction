## Student Performance Prediction

This project aims to predict student performance based on various factors. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and predict student outcomes. This is an end-to-end project deployed on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk. Various machine learning models are used to achieve the best accuracy and predict the output.

### Features

- Data preprocessing: Exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and feature engineering.
- Model selection: Choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithm for prediction.
- Model training: Training the selected model on the dataset.
- Model evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained model.
- Prediction: Using the trained model to make predictions on new data.
